### Phishing
Phishing involves sending fraudulent messages that appear to be from a trusted source, aiming to trick the victim into revealing sensitive information.

**Example**: Email asking for login credentials by pretending to be from the IT department.

### Spear Phishing
Spear phishing is a targeted phishing attack, usually directed at a specific individual or organization. It involves gathering information about the target to make the message appear more legitimate.

**Example**: Sending a personalized email that includes specific details about the recipient’s role or organization.

### Pretexting
Pretexting involves creating a fabricated scenario to obtain private information, often by impersonating someone in authority.

**Example**: Pretending to be an HR representative to get an employee’s personal details.

### Baiting
Baiting involves enticing the victim with a promise or curiosity, such as leaving a USB drive labeled "Confidential" in a visible place.

**Example**: Leaving a malware-infected USB drive in a public area to trick users into connecting it to their systems.

### Defending Against Social Engineering
- **Awareness Training**: Educate employees about social engineering tactics.
- **Verify Identities**: Always verify the identity of people requesting sensitive information.
- **Use Multi-Factor Authentication**: Reduces risk even if credentials are compromised.
