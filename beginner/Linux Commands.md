### Introduction to Linux
Linux is the preferred operating system in cybersecurity due to its flexibility and open-source nature. 

### Basic Commands
- `ls`: Lists directory contents.
- `cd <directory>`: Changes directory.
- `pwd`: Prints current directory.

### File Permissions
Permissions determine who can access or modify files. Use `chmod` to change permissions:

### Network Commands
- `ping <host>`: Tests connectivity to a host.
- `ifconfig` or `ip addr`: Shows IP configuration.
- `netstat`: Displays network connections and open ports.
